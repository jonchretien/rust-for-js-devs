# Rust for JS Devs ü¶Ä

üëãüèΩ I'm currently learning the Rust programming language and wanted to document my journey. I figured some of these resources might be helpful to other JavaScript developers. Right now the plan is to cover beginner topics (since I'm brand new to Rust) and I'll be adding more content as I get further along.

## Setup

This guide won't cover setup and installation since that's expertly handled in ["the book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html).

## Examples

Any JavaScript comparisons assumes ES2015 or greater. I may break apart some of the examples in the future, but for now one example may contain a few key concepts with comments for further explanation. All of this is very much a work in progress, so expect some shuffling around.
