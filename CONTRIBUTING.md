# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PR's for improvements to code snippets, explanations, etc. If there's any doubt or if you think that a word/phrase is used confusingly, **before submitting a PR, open an issue to ask about it.**

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content .

## Typos

If you're going to submit a PR for typo fixes, please be measured in doing so by collecting several small changes into a single PR (in separate commits).
